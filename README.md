This project uses pypdf(https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and gtts(https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
to read part of the contents of a pdf file and turn it into a mp3 file where the google voice reads the text

To run the project run the file text_to_mp3voice.py. Before doing this go to said file and change the directories for the pdf file, saving directory, map name and file name. Make sure the map with 'map_name' is inside the saving_directory. Now run text_to_mp3voice.py and the audio file with the name you gave should be in the directory you gave
